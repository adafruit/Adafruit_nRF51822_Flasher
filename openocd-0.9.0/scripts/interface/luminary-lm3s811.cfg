# Luminary Micro Stellaris LM3S811 Evaluation Kit
#
# http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/stellaris_811_evaluation_kits.html
#
# NOTE:  this is only for boards *before* Rev C, which adds support
# for SWO tracing with ADBUS_6 DBG_ENn and BDBUS_4 SWO_EN signals.
# The "evb_lm3s811" layout doesn't set up those signals.
#
# Rev C boards work more like the other Stellaris eval boards.  They
# need to use the "luminary_icdi" layout to work correctly.
